# FlyingObjects
The purpose of this project is to practice class inheritance, and other Object Oriented Programming concepts such as constructors, access rights, method overriding, etc. The project would also allow you to practice the notion of package creation.

This program demonstrates inheritance by having for instance a Quadcopter which is a Helicopter that additionally has max flying speed attribute. Meanwhile, Quadcopter class inherited the following attributes: number of cylinders, a creation year , and a passenger capacity.
